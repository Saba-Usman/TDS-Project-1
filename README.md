#Explanation: 

I used the GitHub REST API to search for users in Mumbai with over 50 followers. For each user, I retrieved details ,then fetched  their public repositories. Finally, I stored the data in CSV files for analysis.Upon saving the data in csv,i made use of pandas to find answer to the questions.


#Interesting Fact: 
1) The majority of users have joined GitHub after 2020, indicating a recent surge in developer activity in Mumbai.

2)Several users list no company, email, or hireable status, highlighting that many developers rely purely on their open-source contributions for visibility.








#Recommendations: 
Developers should focus on active community engagement and consistent contributions to grow their GitHub presence.
